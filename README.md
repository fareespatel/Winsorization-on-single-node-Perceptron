# Winsorization-on-single-node-Perceptron

The objective was to compare and explore whether Winsorizing can improve the
accuracy or computational effort of a perceptron (single-node classification) algorithm. I
analyzed the Pima Indians diabetes dataset that was extracted from the UCI
data repository for evaluating the objective
